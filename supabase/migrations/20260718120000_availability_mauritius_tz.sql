-- Availability day boundaries must follow Mauritius local time (Indian/Mauritius, UTC+4, no DST),
-- not UTC. Both availability functions anchored "today" and the day buckets to UTC `current_date`
-- and materialized slots at noon UTC. Near the day boundary that is wrong for a Mauritius operator:
-- e.g. at 01:00 Mauritius (21:00 UTC the previous day) `current_date` still reads yesterday, so the
-- calendar offered/created the wrong day, and the noon-UTC slot (16:00 Mauritius) drifted off the
-- intended noon. This re-anchors both to the Mauritius calendar day and materializes slots at noon
-- Mauritius. (The seed already uses `at time zone 'Indian/Mauritius'`; this brings the runtime
-- functions in line.) Logic is otherwise the winning bodies from 20260617200000 / 20260617120300.
