-- Integrity guard for api_book: optionally assert which activity is being booked.
--
-- api_book takes a bare occurrenceId. Prices are always recomputed server-side from that
-- occurrence (so this is not an underpayment hole), but nothing checked that the occurrence
-- belonged to the activity the customer was actually looking at — a hand-edited /checkout?occ=
-- could book a different activity's slot than the title on screen (a support/fraud-dispute
-- vector). When the caller passes `expectedSlug` (the slug of the page it rendered), we verify
-- the occurrence really belongs to that activity and reject the mismatch. The param is OPTIONAL,
-- so existing callers (and the booking API contract) are unchanged.
