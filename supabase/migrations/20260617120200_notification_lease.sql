-- F4: stop the notification drain from double-sending.
--
-- claim_notifications only bumped `attempts` and left the row 'pending'; its FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
-- lock was released at claim-commit — BEFORE the slow network send. A second overlapping drain
-- (manual run vs the */5 cron, or two crons) re-claimed the same still-'pending' row and re-sent it
-- (Resend carries no idempotency key), so a customer could receive duplicate confirmation emails.
--
-- Add a visibility-timeout lease: a claimed row gets `locked_until = now() + lease` and is invisible
-- to other claimers until it passes; a crashed worker's row becomes reclaimable automatically once
-- the lease expires. mark_notification clears the lease on completion (success or terminal failure).
