-- GDPR erasure gap: pickup_location / dropoff_location survived an erasure request.
--
-- Both are free-text columns on `bookings` holding a REAL ADDRESS the customer typed — a home or
-- hotel pickup point, and the destination on a transfer. They are personal data under Art. 4, they
-- are not part of the retained financial record (the money trail is total_minor / payment_state /
-- payouts), and api_erase_user already nulls every other traveller field beside them. They were
-- simply missed. The account data export already carries them (src/lib/account/export.ts), so the
-- Art. 15/20 side is complete — only the Art. 17 side was short.
--
-- api_erase_user is re-applied here in FULL from its current winning definition (the third and last
-- create-or-replace in catch-up.sql, from 20260806000000's lockdown pass) with the two columns added
-- to the anonymize UPDATE. Re-applying the whole winning body — rather than an older ancestor — is
-- what stops this migration silently reverting the caller-identity binding and the guest-email
-- access-control fix that landed in that pass.
